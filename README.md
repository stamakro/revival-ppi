# PPI Networks with missing edges
This repository contains code for reproducing the article *Sequence-based protein-protein interaction predictions did not outperform protein associations from STRING at functional annotation*

## Summary
1. Download the data
2. Install dependencies 
3. Execute script *pipeline.sh*
